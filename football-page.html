                    <p>Copa America 2021 is over, and Argentina is the queen of South America after 28 years, with Messi
                        finally winning his first international title. It was a long journey with 4 group matches and
                        three knock-out matches. But let’s overview how the tournament went. After rejecting the
                        invitation from CONMEBOL, Qatar and Australia forced the competition to be formed of two groups
                        of 5 teams each. </p>

                            <p>Argentina won its first major title in 28 years on Sunday when an Angel Di Maria goal
                                gave the side a 1-0 win over Brazil and a record-equalling 15th Copa America trophy.

                                Di Maria started for just the second time in the Copa and he justified his selection by
                                scoring the opener midway through the first half. Renan Lodi failed to cut out a long
                                ball forward from Rodrigo De Paul and Di Maria lobbed the stranded Ederson with aplomb.

                                HIGHLIGHTS| Copa America Final - Argentina vs Brazil

                                Brazil piled on the pressure in an exciting second half but even with five strikers on
                                the field the side could not get an equaliser against an Argentine defence protected by
                                the outstanding Rodrigo De Paul.

                                Argentina’s win was a particular triumph for Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, who picked
                                up his first ever title in a blue and white shirt after more than a decade of club and
                                individual honours.

                                Messi finished the tournament’s joint top goalscorer with four goals and was elected
                                joint best player along with Neymar. But he was quiet throughout and
                                uncharacteristically missed a golden opportunity to wrap the game up with two minutes
                                remaining.</p>
